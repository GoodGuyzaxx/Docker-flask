# Docker Flask

This README provides instructions for setting up and running a Flask application within a Docker container.  Since no specific description or technology stack was provided, I will make assumptions based on the common practices for Dockerizing Flask applications.

## ✨ Fitur Utama

- **Containerized Application:** The application is packaged within a Docker container, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.
- **Easy Deployment:** Deployment is simplified through Docker's containerization capabilities.
- **Scalability:** The application can be easily scaled by running multiple containers.
- **Isolation:**  The application is isolated from the host system and other applications.


## 💻 Teknologi yang Digunakan

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Reverse Proxy (Likely):** Nginx (Inferred from the presence of `nginx` file)


## 📂 Struktur Proyek

```
/
├── Dockerfile
├── app/       (Assumed directory containing the Flask application code)
│   └── ...
├── docker-compose.yml
└── nginx      (Assumed configuration file for Nginx)
```

## 🛠️ Cara Menjalankan Secara Lokal

These instructions assume a basic familiarity with Docker and Docker Compose.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GoodGuyzaxx/Docker-flask
   cd Docker-flask
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the application:**  The application will likely be accessible via `http://localhost:80` (or a port specified in `docker-compose.yml` or `nginx` configuration).


##  Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues, review the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for specific configurations.
- Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- Check the logs for any errors: `docker-compose logs`


**Note:**  This README is a template.  The specifics of the application, including ports, environment variables, and dependencies, will depend on the contents of the `app` directory and configuration files.  A more comprehensive README would require access to the project's source code.
